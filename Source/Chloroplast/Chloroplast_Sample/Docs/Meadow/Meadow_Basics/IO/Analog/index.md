# Intro

In modern digital electronics, we often deal with finite states of `HIGH` or `LOW`, which represent digital `1`/`0`, or `On`/`Off`, respectively. However, there are many sensors or other integrations that communicate not in binary, but in a range of voltages. For instance, a [TMP35 analog temp sensor](/docs/api/Meadow.Foundation/Meadow.Foundation.Sensors.Temperature.AnalogTemperature.html) might output `0V` when it's reading an ambient temperature of `0ºC`, `1.6V` @ `50ºC`, and `3.3V` @ `100ºC`.

Analog ports are specifically design for this scenario, and are able to operate throughout a specified range of voltages, in both an input (reading) and output (writing) capacity. 

On the Meadow F7 Micro, Analog signals are written or read with a 12-bit resolution, which means that they can have 4,096 steps of resolution.

Meadow has the capabilities to both read and write analog signals, but presently only the input/read functionality is exposed via API.

## Analog Input

Analog input is converted to a digital value via the onboard _Analog to Digital Converter_ (ADC), which is accessed via an [`AnalogInputPort`](/docs/api/Meadow/Meadow.Hardware.AnalogInputPort.html), and created from an `IIODevice`:

```csharp
IAnalogInputPort analogIn = Device.CreateAnalogInputPort(Device.Pins.A02);
```

From there, the voltage can be read via the [`Read()` method](/docs/api/Meadow/Meadow.Hardware.AnalogInputPort.html#Meadow_Hardware_AnalogInputPort_Read_System_Int32_System_Int32_):

```csharp
float voltage = analogIn.Read();
```

**NOTE:** Only analog pins `A0` through `A3` are currently configured. `A4` and `A5` will not currently work.

### Events and IObservable API

As with other input APIs, the Analog input APIs support both events and the `IObservable` pattern, for advanced notification filtering. For more information, see the [Events and IObservable guide](/Meadow/Meadow_Basics/Events_and_IObservable/).

### Input Voltage Tolerance

It's important to note that unlike the digital inputs (which are `5V` tolerant), the analog inputs on the F7 Micro are only `3.3V` tolerant, meaning any input signals above `3.3V` may damage the chip. If you expect input signals to exceed `3.3V`, there are two ways to protect the input.

If your sensor regularly operates at a higher voltage range, for instance, if it's a `5V` sensor, a two resistor [_voltage divider_](/Hardware/Tutorials/Electronics/Part5/Level_Shifting_Lab/) should be used to "divide" the voltage down from `5V` to `3.3V`.

For occasional voltage spikes that can be ignored, the input should be protected with a [Zener diode](/Hardware/Tutorials/Electronics/Part6/General_Diodes) and a [resistor](/Hardware/Tutorials/Electronics/Part4/Resistance/) as illustrated in this [tutorial](https://www.electroniclinic.com/input-overvoltage-protection-for-arduino-inputs-using-a-zener-diode/).

### Analog Reference (`AREF`)

The _analog reference_ (`AREF`) pin provides a reference voltage for the [_Analog to Digital Converter_ (ADC)](/Meadow/Meadow_Basics/IO/Analog/) to compare against. Typically, this should be supplied with `3.3V`, so as a convenience, the `AREF` pin is actually connected to the `3.3V` rail via `0Ω` resistor that is located next to the `D08` pin, just below the main MCU:

![Image showing the location of the AREF 0Ω resistor, which is just below the F7 MCU, and on the right side, when the board is turned so that the USB connector is on top. The resistor is immediately to the left of the D08 header pin.](/Common_Files/F7_Micro_AREF_Resistor.svg)

If you need to provide a different analog reference voltage, make sure to remove that resistor before hooking `AREF` to your voltage reference.

## Analog Output

Analog output can be generated via the _Digital to Analog Converter_ (DAC) on the Meadow device. This feature is not currently exposed, and these docs will be updated when we ship it.
