## Intro

Amperage describes the quantity of charge carriers that are being moved passed a point in any given second.

One of the simplest (though not actually the official) definitions of an [ampere (amp)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampere) is 1 [_coulomb_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coulomb) of charge carriers passing through a given location per second.

One coulomb is equal to 6.242 x 10^18 (6,242,000,000,000,000,000) charge carriers. A fantastically large number, but given the relative size of electrons, one can imagine that number of charges moving on a relatively modest wire. Consider household wiring, which is typically 14 or 12 gauge, and rated at carrying 10 or 15 amps (at 120 volts), respectively.

### Common Amperages

| Appliance                                     | Amperage      |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------|
| 60 Watt incandescent light bulb               | 500mA (0.5A)  |
| 10 Watt LED (60 Watt incandescent equivalent) | ~100mA (0.1A) |
| Hair Dryer                                    | 12 amps       |

### Amp Hours (Ah)

When describing the quantity of charge either available, or used, _amp hours_ (Ah) are used. An amp hour is an hour's worth of amps, or 3,600 coulombs (since there are 3,600 seconds in an hour).

Amp hours are often expressed in _milliampere hours_ (mAh), which is one-thousandth of an amp hour, or 3.6 coulombs. For reference, a typical AA NiMH rechargeable battery will have ~2500 mAh (2.5Ah), and a D NiMH rechargeable has ~10,000 mAh (10 Ah).

### Common Unit Magnitudes

| Magnitude      | Value in amps  |
|----------------|----------------|
| nanoamp (nA)   | 0.000000001A   |
| microamp (ÂµA)  | 0.000001A      |
| milliamp (mA)  | 0.001A         |
| amp (A)        | 1.0A           |
