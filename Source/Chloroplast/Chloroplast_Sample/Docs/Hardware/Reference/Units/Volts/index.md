## Intro

Voltage, measured in volts (V), is the amount of force in which charge carriers are being moved in an electric current.

### Common Source Voltages

| Source                          | Voltage             |
|---------------------------------|---------------------|
| High power transmission lines   | 230kV - 500kV       |
| North American Household Mains  | ~117V (110 nominal) |
| European Household Mains        | ~220V (230 nominal) |
| AA Battery                      | 1.5V                |
| USB Power                       | 5V                  |
| Netduino Digital IO             | 3.3V                |
| Low-power Peripherals           | 1.8V                |

### Common Unit Magnitudes

| Magnitude      | Value in volts |
|----------------|----------------|
| microvolt (ÂµV) | 0.000001V      |
| millivolt (mV) | 0.001V         |
| volt (V)       | 1.0V           |
| kilovolt (kV)  | 1,000V         |
| megavolt (MV)  | 1,000,000V     |
