## Intro

The _[watt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt)_ (W) is a convenience unit to describe the amount of work that current can do, as a factor of voltage and amperage, and is defined as:

```
Watts = Volts * Amps
```

### Common Wattages

| Electrical Current              | Voltage | Amperage | Wattage    |
|---------------------------------|---------|----------|------------|
| Hair Dryer                      | 117V    | 12A      | **1,404W** |
| 60 Watt Incandescent Light Bulb | 117V    | ~0.5A    | **~60W**   |
| iPad/Tablet Charger             | 5V      | ~2A      | **10W**    |
| Netduino                        | 5V      | 40mA     | **0.2W**   |
