## Important Concepts

That was a lot of concepts to take in at once, but it should provide a solid set of fundamental understandings that will aid in understanding how electronic circuits work. As a quick review:

 * _Positive_ and _negative_ charges are arbitrarily named characteristics to describe the attractive and repulsive behavior of subatomic particles such as protons and electrons.
 * Atoms get their net "charge" as _ions_; when there is an imbalance between the number of positively charged protons and negatively charged electrons.
 * Materials that electrons move freely between atoms are electrically _conductive_.
 * Because of historic reasons, circuits are described with the concept of hole-flow, rather than electron flow, which states that charge carriers flow from positive to negative.
 * Electrons flow rather slowly, but their effect travels at the speed of light as an _electromagnetic wave_.
 * _Electromagnetism_ is a three dimensional attraction and repulsion force that arises from the angular momentum of electrons, and a strong magnetic field can be generated from current going through a coiled wire.
 * A current can be _induced_ in a wire when it passes through a magnetic field.
