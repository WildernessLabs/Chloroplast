## Intro

In this lab we'll..

[creating logic gates and indicating via LEDs]



## Requirements

| Item                                     | Approximate Cost (USD) |
| ---------------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| 1N5817 Schottky Diodes                    |
| (2) Switches                             |
| LEDs  ||
| Push Buttons   ||

## Exercise 1: OR Gate

[going through two diodes, the logic/Schottky diode and the LED, so have to account for both voltage drops]

If you have [iCircuit](http://icircuitapp.com), you can begin your design in there. It will help to get the various values of your circuit components at least close to correct:
