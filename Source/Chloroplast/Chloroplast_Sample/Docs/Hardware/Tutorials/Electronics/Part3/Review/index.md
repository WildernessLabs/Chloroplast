## Important Concepts

 * There are two types of electrical current flow; _direct current_ (DC), and _alternating current_ (AC).
 * DC flows in one direction only and is the primary type of current used in logic and control circuits.
 * AC alternates in polarity, flowing back and forth, and is the main type of current found in household electrical mains.
 * AC is the typical current used to power appliances, and is often converted to DC within an appliance to power the logic circuit boards.
 * Mapping the polarity of household AC over time reveals a sine wave, but it may also have other waveforms.
 * AC is described by its _period_ (cycle time), _frequency_ (cycles per second, measured in _hertz_ (`hz`), and _amplitude_ (magnitude of waveform measured in volts).
